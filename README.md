Francois Choquette and James Johnson, in "2008/2012 Election Anomalies, Results, Analysis and Concerns" 
http://madisonvoices.com/pdffiles/2008_2012_ElectionsResultsAnomaliesAndAnalysis_V1.5.pdf, put forth a strategy
for identifying swapped votes from voting machines - by recognizing that the propensity to swap votes would increase
with the size of the precinct, and by analyzing the percentage of votes allocated to each candidate as each successively 
larger precinct was added in to the collection. 

I have reproduced their mathematics and charted some results from my home state, North Carolina.  The aforementioned paper
provides various examples of ordinary (mostly straight horizontal line after a little noise on the left) results and 
suspicious results (slopes after the noise from small precincts).  Here is one chart that doesn't look quite right:

You can help by expanding this code to work with other places, by following up on unusual results, 
or by spreading the word to others!
